- Shorten sentences. Use fewer words to communicate the same message.
- Use words you'd say during face-to-face communication; if you don't say "therefore," don't write it.
- Data instead of adverbs like "most," "few," or "nearly."
- Be objective. "The error count is 0" vs. "It's fixed."
- Use writing assistance. Use tools for writing assistance, including generative artificial intelligence.
